Just a simple Game I whipped up in a day or so. Focused on just making something playable/controlable.

Controls: 
Movement left and right   -    Arow Keys
Jump                      -    Up Arrow (jump amount varies based on how long you hold up)
Shoot Projectile          -    Space (max 1 projectile at a time)
Change Projectile type    -    Shift
Sword                     -    Control
