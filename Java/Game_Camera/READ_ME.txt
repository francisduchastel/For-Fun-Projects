An updated version of Game_Map (see that folder for more info). Added a functional camera and camera controls (number pad arrows, i.e. camera down = 2, camera up = 8, camera right = 6, camera left = 4).
Also updated the map making tool (Merged) to have a scale factor. Recreated a (very bad) version of 1-1 in Super Mario as the map (used a scale of 1.25).
