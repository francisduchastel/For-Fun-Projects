A continuation of my "Simple Game" project (see that project in the Java folder). Decided to actually add a collision system instead of hard coding it, a collision system based on 3 types of objects, floors (1), walls (2),
and ceilings (3). Also created a simple map maker tool (called Merged) that takes a .csv file from Google Sheets (should work with Excel but I haven't checked) and translates it into a format the game can read. Examples are
included for 1 map in both formats (.csv and the .txt that the game can read), for the .csv, cells with A are considered blocks and the cell with B is the spawning location. There are some horizontal gaps between blocks as I
was trying to make it easier to move through holes, but that is still a work in progress. The next step is probably to add a camera system. I think my goal as of right now is to recreate the first level of the original Super
Mario but we'll see.
