Added Sword (used with shift), hitbox is not smooth on purpose, supposed to represent fencing type strike with a ready state (smaller hitbox) and a strike state (larger hitbox). Hitbox is also actually multiple small hitboxed with the intention to create different sword patterns in the future (such as an overhead slash). Also added Boomerang (used with Cntr) with the intention of allowing it to hit switches through walls in the future.
